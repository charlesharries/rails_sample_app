<h1>About this fucking thing</h1>

<p>You see this shit? This is the fucking sample app for Michael Hartl's <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org">Rails Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Hartl wants me to just copy his fucking words for my apps. But I'm not gonna do that, because the web is about building on what other people are making.</p>

<p>That said this would a poor fucking excuse for a Rails Tutorial Sample App if I didn't jam Hartl's text in here somewhere. So here ya fucking go:</p>
